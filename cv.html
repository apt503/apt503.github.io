		<ul>
        <li>My primary research focus is on the development of artificial intelligence tools to help improve the diagnosis and treatment for suffers of movement disorders, with a particular focus on improving the diagnosis times for children with cerebral palsy. My secondary focus is on the development of novel artificial intelligence techniques to help develop transparency in the decision-making process of artificial intelligence tools. This work was built upon my EPSRC new investigator award, which commenced in 2019.</li>
