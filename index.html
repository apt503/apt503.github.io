        <h2>About me</h2>
<p>Since February 2020, I have been an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham where 
I am a member of the Cyber-physical Health and Assistive Robotics Technologies Lab (CHART) and the Mixed Reality Lab (MRL). 
My main research skills are in the areas of machine learning, model deployment and experimental design. </p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>Throughout my time as an academic, I have worked in a multi-disciplinary environment between the schools of computer science,
 medicine, biology, and electronics at various institutions including the University of York, the Norwegian University of Science 
 and Technology, and currently at the University of Nottingham. My Google Scholar profile can be found <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YNvqLPwAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>.</p>

<p>At present, my research can be divided into two key themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The development of new technologies to improve the diagnosis time and treatment of movement disorders, particularly focusing on gait and ambulation in children. To do this, I use a combination of movement sensors, visual recordings alongside pose estimation techniques all wrapped up in machine learning.</li>
  <li>I am also working on the application of bio-inspired and evolutionary algorithms to understand the adaptation of biological species and the overlap between in silico and in biological systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recently Published Work</h2>
